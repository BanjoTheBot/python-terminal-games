# Python Terminal Games

A collection of games and tests I made, accessible through one master file.

## Games

### Russian Roulette

Uses randomization and a list to simulate a game of Russian Roulette

### Idea Submissions

Have a game idea? Submit an issue describing the game, and I'll consider it!

Simple guidelines:

- Must be achievable as a terminal game, i.e; no PyGame or games that use graphics, must be all text
- Cannot be too complicated or long, these are meant to be short games to play when bored,
meaning nothing like Adventure or Story games
